Thankyou to all who applied to be part of this event!</strong></br></br>Following the success of the past two years Auckland is again hosting ResBaz in 2017!</br></br>The Research Bazaar is a (free-of-charge) 3-day intensive festival and conference where researchers come together to up-skill in next generation digital research tools and scholarship. In the spirit of a marketplace or bazaar, ResBaz is a highly participatory event where researchers from many different disciplines can learn, share knowledge and skills, and have fun!</br></br>Who should attend? Researchers at ALL levels from ALL disciplines. PhD and research Masters students are especially encouraged to apply. Research technologists who support researchers to do their job should also come along!</br></br>ResBaz is particularly aimed at those new to digital research tools.

schedule: Each day at ResBaz will be roughly split into morning and afternoon events. Following a Key Story from one of our exciting speakers, the mornings will consists of <a href='https://software-carpentry.org/'>Software Carpentry</a> lessons (Unix Shell, Python or R, Git) for all participants. You can choose your flavour - Software Carpentry with Python or R. Following a scrumptious lunch, afternoon sessions will be a mix of different concurrent elective workshops, fun activities, and discussions.</br></br>Come prepared to get involved and find your research tribe.<br><br>Below is a rough schedule, which may change as we approach the event. There will be many other fantastic topics and sessions too, ResBaz is not limited to only these.</br></br>Click on the sessions for details.

Sir Peter is internationally respected for his work promoting the use of evidence in policy formation and the translation of scientific knowledge into better social, economic, and environmental outcomes. Sir Peter is the author of over 700 scientific papers, reviews and books for both technical and lay audiences. His research has won him numerous awards and international recognition including Fellowship of the Commonwealth’s most prestigious scientific organisation, The Royal Society (London). 
 - name: Professor Donna Rose Addis
   img: img/akl/Addis_2014.jpeg
   blurb: Digital Social Science.

 - name: Dr. Rochelle Constantine
   img: img/akl/Rochelle.jpeg
   blurb: Rochelle is a Senior Lecturer at the University of Auckland and runs the Marine Mammal Ecology Group. She uses an inter-disciplinary approach to answering questions about cetacean ecology and collaborates widely to try and resolve some of the conservation issues facing cetaceans from the tropics to Antarctica. As a consequence of the breadth of her research she is a member of several international scientific panels overseeing cetacean research and conservation programmes.
 - name: Dr. Daniel Hikuroa  
   img: img/akl/Dan.jpeg
   blurb: Dan is an Earth Systems Scientist at the University of Auckland. He has worked with Māori communities for the past decade helping to realise their dreams or solve their issues. Dan is also interested in the interface between science and indigenous knowledge and is internationally recognised for his work in that area. Dan will discuss mauri – a Māori word, but a universally understood concept, increasingly associated with sustainability.
 - name: Associate Professor Cather Simpson
   img: img/akl/Cather.png
   blurb: Food, Farms and Photonics. The Photon Factory is a high-tech laser facility at U. Auckland that uses state-of-the-art photonics for everything. Cather will talk about how exotic light-based technologies are giving her team new insight and tools to help shape the dairy industry in the 21st century. She’ll also address how the Photon Factory’s fun-loving, cross-disciplinary teams underpin the lab’s thriving entrepreneurial ethos.
 - name: Kate Riegle-Van West
   img: img/akl/kate.jpg
   blurb: Kate is an interdisciplinary artist interested in the health benefits of International Poi (a ball on the end of a cord which is swung in circles around the body). She has studied poi in a variety of ways over the past decade, such as opening a flow arts centre in Chicago, creating the Orbitar (a digital poi musical instrument), and giving a TED talk on poi. She is currently conducting PhD research on the effects of poi on physical and cognitive function in healthy older adults at the University of Auckland, working between the Centre for Brain Research and the Dance Department. This research is the first to evaluate the health benefits of poi through a randomised controlled trial, and will hopefully pave the way for future poi and health research. Kate will give a brief presentation about her research, and then it's your turn to have a go, as Kate will lead an International Poi lesson. No experience necessary!

        <h4 class="modal-title">The Unix Shell</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="modal-body">
        <p>The Unix shell has been around longer than most of its users have been alive. It has survived so long because it’s a power tool that allows people to do complex things with just a few keystrokes. More importantly, it helps them combine existing programs in new ways and automate repetitive tasks so they aren’t typing the same things over and over again. Use of the shell is fundamental to using a wide range of other powerful tools and computing resources (including “high-performance computing” supercomputers). These lessons will start you on a path towards using these resources effectively.</p>

                <p>Applications to attend ResBaz Auckland are now <strong>CLOSED</strong>.</br></br>Research Bazaar is a free event, subsidised by our sponsors, and it is expected that those who apply will be able to participate during all 3 days. Because space is limited, regrettably we can't guarantee everyone a place at ResBaz 2017 (sad face). If over subscribed, selection will be based on your needs and commitment. We also aim for a cohort that is as diverse as possible, and across the full spectrum of research disciplines.</br></br>Applicants will be notified of their success before Christmas. If you're not offered an initial place please don't be too discouraged. There will be plenty of other activities and opportunities for you throughout the year - including a Boot Camp over the winter break offering similar opportunities to learn. And don't forget <a href="https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/HackyHour/">Hacky Hour</a> where you can join in and meet others every Thursday - 3pm at Strata.
